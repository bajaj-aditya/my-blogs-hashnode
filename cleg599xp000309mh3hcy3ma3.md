# Learning Frontend: A Survival Guide - #0

All right, I think for a certain portion of my college life, I absolutely despised front-end, because let's be honest I am not particularly good at making things look pretty.

I more often than not felt that CSS was like a moody girlfriend, producing outputs at her whim and never truly giving me what I want from her. I never went particularly far with the front-end part and my monkey brain quickly shifted to learning about scaling email solutions and automation.

One thing I have learned over time in getting better at anything is to not only make **marginal gains** but to at least survive long enough in the markets to be the hero.

Slowly, I feel I should give her another chance and have much more meaningful substantiated discussions & not the shallow talks I used to have with her.

### Why Frontend?

**1\. Design**

One of the many things that I am terrible at is design, and I used to think that way for a long long time. But recently I had some mindset shift, everything in the world can essentially be boiled down to learnable skills even things like creativity.

I think design/creativity is a skill that will pay me dividends down the decade.

**2\. Practicality**

Every consumer-centric field employs some form of design in some form or the other. React is the name of the game on the internet and even in the app industry (React Native). A good design base and knowledge of React seem like practical skills to have.

**3\. Mindset**

I was recently reading an article where it talked about the growth mindset, how you truly achieve excellence by being extremely curious, and the reason to chew glass and get out of our comfort zone.

Lastly, Sometimes you just want to prove to yourself that you can do it.

### Path Forward

I think I should start with extreme basics and then build on top of it. I would first complete The Odin Project and then look down further paths.

I would keep sharing what I am learning here, as the goal is to become the ultimate casanova, and hope that everyone else enjoys the ride.
