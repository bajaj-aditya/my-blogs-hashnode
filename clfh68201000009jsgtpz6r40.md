This challenge basically teaches how nothing is really private on the blockchain and all data can be seen by everyone. The word `private` or `internal` should not be used to store "private" things like passwords.

> Objective: Unlock the vault to pass the level!

### Background

In the previous challenges, I talked about the concept of storage. Notice how in EVM data is stored in slots that are 32 bytes in size. For Example:

```solidity
contract Example {
 uint256 a; //slot0
 uint128 b; //slot1
 uint128 c; //slot1
} 

//Good Practice
```

```solidity
contract Example {
 uint128 a; //slot0
 uint256 b; //slot1
 uint128 c; //slot2
} 

//Bad Practice
```

The first state variable is assigned slot0, the second variable is assigned slot1, and so on. If by chance a variable needs less than 32 bytes, it's packed with the next variable to optimize storage.

According to Solidity documentation:

> Private functions and state variables are only visible for the contract they are defined in and not in derived contracts.

That is, other contracts can't access [private](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-136) variables, but they still are visible.

*Note:*

1. *It is recommended to encrypt important data and then store it in the blockchain. The decryption key should never be on-chain in any shape or form whatsoever.*
    
2. *To save gas, it is recommended to use* `constant` *and* `immutable` *variables, their value has to be fixed at compile time and construction time respectively. Hence, a storage slot is not reserved for these types of variables.*
    

### Code of Importance

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vault {
  bool public locked; //state variable (slot0)
  bytes32 private password; //point of attack, since it can be read as explained above. (slot1)

  constructor(bytes32 _password) {
    locked = true; //initialised as true, we need it to be false
    password = _password; //password is set by the deployer. 
  }

  function unlock(bytes32 _password) public {
    if (password == _password) { //if we guess the password
      locked = false; //we unlock the lock. 
    }
  }
}
```

Plan of attack: Get the data stored in slot1, since we know bytes32 will take an entire slot --&gt; put it in function `unlock`.

### Solution

1. Create a new level instance and fire up the console.
    
2. ```javascript
    await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 1)
    //adds your instance address, 1 is the slot number.
    ```
    
3. ```javascript
    await contract.unlock('0x412076657279207374726f6e67207365637265742070617373776f7264203a29')
    
    //fun task: convert the password from hex to ascii, and check what it is.
    ```
    
4. Submit Instance.
